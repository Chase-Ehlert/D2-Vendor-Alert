# VS Code Debugging Instructions

If you're using VS Code as your IDE, there is an easy method to setting up the debugger. VS Code has a built-in debugging feature called ["Auto Attach"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging).

- Open up the Command Pallete in VS Code, Ctrl+Shift+P, and type in "Auto Attach".
- You should see an option called "Debug: Toggle Auto Attach", select this.
- A list of options should appear in the prompt: Always, Smart, Only with Flag, and Disabled.
- Select "Smart" from this menu.

There ya go! Now the debugger is ready to attach whenever any of the run scripts are started.
